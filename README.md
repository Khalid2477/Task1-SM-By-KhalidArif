Task 1 for Smart Methods summer training 2021 done by Khalid Arif,

I have created this project as my first task for my summer training in Smart Methods in 2021.

I have learned how to create a html and php also connecting them together through a database.

In this project i have been directed to create a control arm for robot interface,

I have created a database which holds the data that is put by the slider that I created in a html using php,

I have used XAMPP as my server to control the database from phpadmin,

And through the code in html and php connected to the database i have succesfully connected them.
